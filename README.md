### What is Ripple?
ripple is simply a small animation project that displays a .. well.. a ripple effect.
its 4 circles inside of each other that light up sequentially.

an effect i have seen in VideoGameDunkey's new puplisher site named 'BigMode', although mine has less circles and is slower in transition (both tweakable).

for a faster effect, simpply divide the animation length and the animation delay by the same number, the bigger the number used in this division the faster.

P.S could have hipnotic effects so treat carefully :o

### Phase 2: Ripple Button.
a button was added with complete animations, i simply need to link both components into one big one and display both ^_^
